- **Personalized Financial Insights**: Developed an AI-powered analytics dashboard that provides customized financial advice based on spending patterns and savings goals.
- **Seamless Payment Integration**: Built integrations with multiple payment platforms including Apple Pay, Google Pay, and peer-to-peer transfer services.

## Technologies Used

- **React Native**: For cross-platform mobile development with native performance.
- **Firebase**: For real-time database functionality and authentication services.
- **TensorFlow Lite**: For on-device machine learning to power the financial insights feature.
- **Azure Security Services**: For implementing bank-grade security protocols and compliance measures.

## Challenges and Learnings

The primary challenge was implementing robust security measures without compromising the user experience. We conducted extensive user testing to refine the authentication flow, ensuring it remained both secure and frictionless. Another challenge was optimizing the app's performance while processing complex financial data in real-time.
