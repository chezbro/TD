## Overview

Developed a comprehensive e-commerce platform that leverages artificial intelligence to deliver personalized shopping experiences. The platform includes advanced inventory management, secure payment processing, and a robust admin dashboard for business analytics and operations management.

## Key Features

- **AI Product Recommendations**: Implemented a machine learning algorithm that analyzes user behavior and purchase history to suggest relevant products, increasing average order value by 22%.
- **Inventory Management System**: Created a real-time inventory tracking system with automated reordering capabilities and supplier integration to prevent stockouts.
- **Multi-payment Gateway**: Integrated multiple payment processors including credit cards, digital wallets, and buy-now-pay-later options to maximize conversion rates.
- **Business Intelligence Dashboard**: Developed a comprehensive analytics suite that provides actionable insights on sales trends, customer behavior, and marketing campaign performance.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js & Redux**: For building a fast, SEO-friendly frontend with efficient state management.
- **Python & Django**: For creating a robust backend API with machine learning capabilities.
- **MongoDB**: For flexible, scalable data storage optimized for e-commerce operations.
- **Stripe & PayPal APIs**: For secure payment processing with multiple payment methods.

## Challenges and Learnings

A major challenge was optimizing the recommendation engine to balance accuracy with performance. We implemented a hybrid approach combining collaborative filtering with content-based recommendations, which significantly improved suggestion relevance without impacting page load times. Another challenge was designing a system that could scale during high-traffic sales events, which we addressed through strategic caching and load balancing.

## Outcome

The e-commerce platform has successfully processed over $2 million in transactions since launch, with a 30% increase in customer retention compared to the client's previous solution. The AI recommendation engine has contributed to a 22% increase in average order value, while the improved inventory management system has reduced stockouts by 45%.
