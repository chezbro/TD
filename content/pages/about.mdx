## Our Mission

We're dedicated to breaking down geographical barriers in software development, proving that great code knows no borders. Through this blog, I share our experiences, strategies, and lessons learned in building successful offshore development teams.

## What's the point of blogging?

- I believe you can learn a lot by following other people's journeys. I'm following a lot of other creators too.
